## Lesson Topic: *Nested Looping*

### Collaboration techique: *Paired Programming*

### Example Lesson Student Facing Code: 

```java
public class Loops{

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    // 1. Nested looping

      // make a loop that runs 10 times


        // add a print statement to let people know the outer loop is running


        // make a loop INSIDE the loop you made, run it 5 times
        // if this loop seems to happen too few times, or if you get an error, talk it out with
        // your group, and then check with me to see if you've figured out why

          // add a message to let people know the inner loop is running

    
  	// 2. Looping & Conditionals
    
    
    // expand and intigrate activites
    // make a loop that runs 10 times

      // add a message to let people know the outer loop is running

      // if i is even
        // then loop 10 times
          // add a message to let people know the inner loop is running
            // every other loop print "i and j are both even!"



  }
}

### Participant pre-requisites
Students know about nested loops. Nested loops have been presented but students have not written the code themselves. Students have experience with conditionals and modulo and have the ability to incorporate it into later code. 

---
### Scaffolding / Differentiation 
* Comment codes to suggest what code students should be writing.
* Float time at tables
* Demo the code for the class 

---
### Partnered Coding Directions, Prompts, and Consideration
* Choose the less skilled student to be the driver for the first code block.
* Have a second code block on hand like example 1 above, make sure the less skilled student is the driver for this, this way I can incoporate *AB partnernships* into the pairing. Do the same with the second set. Do as many reps as needed, making sure to keep the AB altenatives.
* Make sure only one machine is open per pair of students.
* Make sure transitions are followed.
* Have contigency pairing in case of any real partnership failures.
* Focus in on the method of code colab and give extra time for the first round, correcting student behavior when needed.
* Partnered programming with an AB partnership should allow for students who are stronger in the subject to support their peers. Intentionally doing AB Hard->Less Hard scaling will allow students who need to develop more skills practice with more scaffolding.
* Supports students workin in pairs which increases their visiability and accountability to their peers, hopefully reducing lurkers in larger groups, while allowing those who feel weeker with the material to have more direct access without as much peer visability.

### Go!
1. Review some single loop stuff we have done in the past.
1. Look at an example of a loop with conditionals so that students feel better about loops doing something more than just a single thing every time
1. Explain the basics of partnered coding, have half of the computers shut for the acitivty
1. Explain the structure of it. Choose a student to help model the process working as my partner for the live code activity.
1. Do a live code of a nested loop
1. Students work on intro activity, generally have 3 or 4 actvities like number 1 to let the students get a good deal of practive. Do this in partners or groups or informal grouping and peer support. 
1. Move on to more complex examples like #2, do 4 or 5.
1. Have students come up with something funny to do with a dual nested loop and drive their partner though it and then switch off.
