Methods Summer 2022
GALLERY TOUR LOG



====================================================
DISCOVERIES:
* found out the actual names of our courses without having to look them up on CUNY
* archatect (sp?) template is really nice formating
* realized we should put our names on theses
* some of the themes work really well with graphics
* some emoticons will work and display correctly.
* looks like animated gif imports will only load the first image
* less is more. a site with a minimal amount of stuff, say in a table, can be very informative at a quick glance
* some of the MD pages look just as good as some of the HTML & CSS pages


LINGERING QUESTIONS:
* Should the instructions for making these sites have included a prompt to have your name on them, and to describe something about what you highlight

COMMENTS/CONCERNS/OTHER:
* Can not easily tell who's is who's in many cases
* Should we have a prompt to list collaborators on things and links to their repos?
* Some of the themes may come out with unclear divsions between the sections and the content.
* Code samples that seem small on a plain MD page may look really big and take up lots of space with a theme added.
