# Community Building Techniques
#### written with collaborative input from Team hashtagBEGUDFAM
Roster: William LaMorie, K. Maschmeyer, M. Yearwood, J. Theobald

### Environment
* school size: ~ 45 per grade level
* school grade range: 6-12
* faculty count: .5
* courses: Computer Science I & II presented as "Robotics & intigrated System" / "Web & Game Design"

* * *

### Initiative: Community and Regonal Interection

#### How It Works
Reach out to other entities in the area to leverage their positioning the larger CS & tech space to engage the students further in their interest in CS. Ideal organizations are -
* Local code shop visits
* Local university sponsored coding competion
* Local maker space

How to do:
1. Contact the organization.
1. Talk about a trip or a visit to the school.
1. Struture up the activity or time more as needed.
1. Establish partnership/relationship and develop out more.


#### Expected Positive Outcomes
* Shows students that they can find work in the area in CS (which is a big concern for some of the students in a low income rural area).
* Allows students to make relationships with members of the community who may become peers or mentors.
* Chance to have student internerships and post education jobs.
* Build commuity awarenes of CS program

#### Rollout Timeline
* Trips can be planned as soon as this school year.
* Milestones: CS competition team, students getting jobs or interships

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
Student Surveys
Student Uptake in activity(s)
Student Empolyment with partner(s)

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* Timming
* Covid restrictions
* Trip funds

### Club: Girls Who Code

#### How It Works
Allows female students 6-12 to have a place to develop coding skills outside the classroom without the added distraction of male peers. Studies have shown this can be helpful for some female students.

#### Expected Positive Outcomes
Reduce disparity in numbers between male and female students in CS classes.

#### Rollout Timeline
* Roll out over the school year starting 2nd MP

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
Student enrollment

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* Lack of activity period at school/time between end of day and sports.
* Would be ideal to recruit a female teacher
