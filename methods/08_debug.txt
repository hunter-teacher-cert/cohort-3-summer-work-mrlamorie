08_Debugging Activity

Group Name: Error on Line 10

Group Members: Marisa Shuman, Yeidy Levels, Wayne Tobias, Will LaMorie

Activity: Students are given a block of code that has ONE error in it. 
Students are familiar with the concepts that are present in the code but not how to find the error. 

Students will add a comment to each line of code where they explain what that line is doing (what it means in non code words). 

Students will identify the error in the code and indicate a correction.

for (int i=0; i>data.length; i++) {

  if (data[i]%2 == 0) {
    System.out.print(data[i] + " is even");
  }

  else {
    System.out.print(data[i] + " is odd");
  }

}


Scaffolding: 
- Other types of errors that could be included are:
    * double vs single equal signs
    * , instead of ; in for loops
    * switch the print statements so even/odd are swapped
    * add () after the .length in the for loop
    * use .size() instead of .length

Extension: 
- Ask the students "Where do you think another student might make an error?"
