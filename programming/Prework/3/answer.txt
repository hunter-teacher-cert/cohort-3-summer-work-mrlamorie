Exercise 1:
1.1:

Expected output:
No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.

1.2:
I am a bit confused by this. Stack diagrams show the state of variables, and there
are none. Unless you want a Stack diagramin showing there is no value for args, which would be:

main [ args  [none] ]

If the question is asking for us to use the notation to show what the output of each function would be then it would be something like:

zoop [wug. \nYou wugga wug.\n]
main [No, I wug\nYou wugga wug\nI wug.\n]
baffle [wug.\n]
ping [.\n]

1.3:
I don't want to run that because it's a non-terminating recursive.
But the output should be something like (assuming you made the modification and ran
in place otherwise):
No, I wug.
wug.
wug.
wug.
... forever, assuming replit doesn't have a too much recursion blocker.
