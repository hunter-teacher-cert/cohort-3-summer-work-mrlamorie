Exercise 1 solutions:

1.1:

i | n
=====
10|10
5 |10
6 |10
3 |10
4 |10
2 |10

1.2:
Expected output (same as i column above)
10
5
6
3
4
2

1.3:
Informally - Yes, this fxn will always terminate for posative values. 
For all even values the resultant value is one half of the current value.
All odd values have 1 added to them, making them even. Therefor, with any value 
greater than 2, the last 3 steps of i will be 4 (either previous i/2 or previous i + 1), 2, 1 (terminate). For the value of 2, it will follow the last 2 steps listed.
For 1, it will terminate without output.
