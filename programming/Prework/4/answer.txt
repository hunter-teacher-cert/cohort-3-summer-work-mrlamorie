Prework 04:

Exercise 1:
if ((x > 0 ) && (x < 10) ){
  System.out.println("positive single digit number.");
}

Exercise 2.1:
based on the pre 03 work I feel like with these stack list you may want to see
args [none] here, but the online book does not use that convetion. I will include
it, but it is not totally clear. Mostly I found the stack diagram exercise for
a program with no vars to be very confusing to me.

main [ args [none]  ]
     [ bizz [5]     ]
     [ buzz [2]     ]  

clink [ fork [4]  ]

zoop [ fred ["breakfast "]  ]
     [ bob  [4]          ]

ping [ strangStrung ["not "] ]


Exercise 2.2:
The expected output is:
just for
any not more
It's breakfast
!

Exercise 3:
main [ args [none]  ]
nLines [ n [4] ]  
nLines [ n [3] ]  
nLines [ n [2] ]  
nLines [ n [1] ]
nLines [ n [0] ]
